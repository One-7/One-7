Welcome to my humble github... my name is Luka but one7 or tosh is perfectly fine. A few things about me... I like using the three dots as a way to
connect my sentences. I aspire to be a web-developer wether that will be a front-end or a back-end I am not really quite sure yet.

I seek experience and knowledge in anything really. Currently learning or working on back-end development (Laravel).
My skills are made-up of:
  - Semi-advanced understanding of Javascript, HTML, CSS
  - Advanced understanding of databases and SQL
  - Acknowledgeable knowledge on Node.js
  - Advanced usage of PHP
  
In other aspects of my life I like sports, specifically basketball and american football, one of which I actually do myself. Games have always been a
big part of me and my way of comprehending the world. I never watched anime and my favourite show is Naruto.

Yeah that pretty much sums it up if you feel like contacting me and teaching me a thing or two or are just looking for recruits for a project you can reach me
